"""SummarizationOrchestrationService — on-demand pipeline (business-logic-model.md §2).

  cacheLookup → costGate → selectSource → refine → loadGlossary → routeLength →
  generate(buffer) → groundingValidate(1 retry) → assemble → writeThrough → emitTelemetry

Three-tier degradation kept distinct (nfr-design §1.3):
  • cost   → CostDegradedDTO  (U6 get_budget_state, single authority — never re-judged)
  • outage → AbstainDTO       (LlmUnavailable after one retry; Bedrock circuit)
  • source → abstract fallback / SourceUnavailableDTO

Streaming (Q5/BR-S8) is buffer-validate-then-render: the structured draft is validated as
a whole before exposure (no ungrounded token leaks, FR-5). Progressive client render is an
API/presentation concern; the domain returns a complete, validated result.
